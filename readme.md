## Workflow

Te first thing I want to know are the basic function of D3 and that's why I choose to watch the video: ['Introduction to D3' by Curran Kelleher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jvoTV54nXw).

The second thing was choosing a data and making sensen out of it. For me it was the language data. 

After that, I went searching  for a code example to get inspiration from and the [Bar chart by Mike Bostock](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3885304) is a really great one

The last thing is just getting started ")
Most of the code is self writin.
